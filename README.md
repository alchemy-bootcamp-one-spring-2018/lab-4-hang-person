# Project: Hang Person Game

## Summary
This is a lab project created for Alchemy Code Lab by @AttilaTheHen & @MariahAdams. We created a word guessing game based on the traditional 'Hangman' game. To win the game, you enter letters to complete the randomly selected word. If you guess incorrectly, a body part is added to your hang person. You have 6 guesses, make them count!
